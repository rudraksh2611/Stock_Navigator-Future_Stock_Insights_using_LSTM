# Stock_Prediction_Using-LSTM
This is my project which I created in my summer break as I am learning ML Concepts from my current internship at DRDO. So, i tried to apply that in this project. First I preprocess the data in my local system usign Jupyter notebook then on Google Colab I trained my model for predicting the future closing price of the INFOSYS stock.
